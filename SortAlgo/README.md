# Comparison between threads and processes through sorting algorithm

## Description
This project is mainly to show the difference between threads and processes in
terms of execution time.

## Prerequiste
- C language
- Data Structures.
- Basic understanding of process and threads.


## Installation
1. Provide the input file.
2. Compile the code using normal C language compiler on linux.
3. Run the compiled file.

## Usage
USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. The input file contains the total number of elements present in the file, then from 
second line the elements of the array for sorting are to be provided.
2. Output shows the start time (before sorting) and ending time (after sorting).
3. The total time taken is also printed on console that is in seconds. 


## History
Threads were basically used to reduce the time taken by a program to execute. Threads 
are capable of reducing the execution time when we are using multicore processsors.
In case of small programs the threads take longer to execute as context switching time 
is much more effective. As every thread makes its own PCB and stack so its takes more 
time for execution.
